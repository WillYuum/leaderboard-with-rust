# Leaderboard-with-Rust


 I'd like to use this project to learn rust and run this on a server when I release a game to keep track of the high scores & add some extra excitement to the game.

## How to run docker with project:
- Use [Dev Container](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) to open the project.

## How to run backend
- Make sure you have rust installed.
- Add .env file with the following variables like in `.env.example`.
- Run `cargo run` to start the server.

## Goals for v1.0
- [ ] Every API request should return a JSON response to the client.
- [ ] Make sure to use CORS to allow requests from only the client.
