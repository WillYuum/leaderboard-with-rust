# Leaderboard-with-Rust


 I'd like to use this project to learn rust and run this on a server when I release a game to keep track of the high scores & add some extra excitement to the game.

---

## How to run
- Make sure you have rust installed.
- Add .env file with the following variables like in `.env.example`.
- Run `cargo run` to start the server.

---

## Goals for v1.0
- [ ] Every API request should return a JSON response to the client.
- [ ] Make sure to use CORS to allow requests from only the client.
